    "# Homework 2 \u2014 Efficient Finite-State Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework 2 focuses on using dynamic programming to compute expected rewards and optimal plans.  The methods explored here are fairly general.  Rather than write task-specific dynamic programming algorithms by hand, we will use *generic* algorithms that are built into the finite-state toolkit, and apply them to *task-specific* weighted finite-state machines.  Thus, our methods will apply broadly \u2014 whenever the models and reward functions can be defined using finite-state machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking:** We are going to be doing a supervised *chunking* task.  \"Chunks\" are interesting non-empty substrings of the input $\\boldsymbol{x}$.  The correct chunks $\\boldsymbol{y}$ are known not to overlap with one another, and our prediction $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is similarly a set of non-overlapping chunks.  So chunking is sort of like parsing without any recursive structure.  There are $O(J^2)$ possible chunks in a sentence of length $J$, namely the substrings of the form $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i:j}$ for $0 \\leq i < j \\leq J$.  We would like our algorithms to run in $O(J^2)$ as well (rather than the $O(J^3)$ that is needed for the more general problem of context-free parsing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will consider the task of named entity recognition (NER), in which the chunks refer to \"named entities\" such as specific persons, places, and organizations.  Treating this as a chunking task means that our annotated data will not be able to mark both of the overlapping named entities in `[The [Johns Hopkins] University]`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking as tagging:** We will encode a chunking as an \"IOB\" (or \"BIO\") tagging of the words in each sentence.  Thus, $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in {\\mathcal X}^*$ is a sequence of words, and $\\boldsymbol{y} \\in {\\mathcal Y}^* = \\{\\text{I,O,B}\\}^*$ is a sequence of tags.  The first word of every chunk is tagged with `B` (\"beginning\"), and the remaining words of that chunk are tagged with `I` (\"inside\").  All remaining words are tagged with `O` (\"outside\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence of length $J$, the set of legal taggings $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal Y}$ is actually a bit smaller than ${\\mathcal Y}^\\text{J}$.  For example, it does not include `OII` or `III`, because that is not the correct encoding of any set of chunks, and hence could not be decoded.  The restriction is that every `I` must be immediately preceded by either `B` or another `I`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are unlabeled chunks.  If we wanted to label each chunk as `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, etc., then we would need a larger tag set ${\\mathcal Y}$ to encode this labeled chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:** As our tagging model $p(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$, we'll use a first-order linear-chain CRF with features that are described below.  Just as for HMMs, inference in this simple model can be performed in $O(J)$ time by the forward-backward algorithm.  We'll discuss some $O(J^2)$ computations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets and Algorithms:** We'll work on the Dutch NER data from the CONLL 2002 Shared Task, in which all words are lowercased (so capitalization features can't be used to help).  We have prepared two different datasets for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first dataset consists of `train-small` and `dev-small`.  These contain only sentences of length 5 or less and can be used for brute-force training (as in homework 1), since you can enumerate the entire set $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Y}}$ when computing the gradient ($|\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Y}}| < 3^5 = 243$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second dataset consists of `train`, `dev` and `test`, which contain much longer sequences (up to $45$ words) and thus can **not** be brute forced ($3^{45} = 2954312706550833698643$).  To deal with this larger domain, we will have to use the fact that our scoring function is decomposable, in the sense that we can score possible taggings $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and plans $\\boldsymbol{a}$ using FSTs."

    "*Note:* If you want to be extra-efficient, then you might not want your `ParamDict` keys to include full strings.  Instead, replace larger objects like the strings `'Noun'` and `'violin'` with small fixed-size objects like integers or pointers, which are compact to store and can be very rapidly hashed and compared.  To do this, when you read a string token, convert it to an integer using an `Integerizer`, or convert it to an [interned string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) using [`sys.intern`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern).  Then use tuples of these objects as the `ParamDict` keys for the various model features.  This efficiency trick might be worthwhile in an optimized Cython, C++, or Java implementation. "

    "* **False negatives:** `true - true_pos` is the number of missed chunks.  False negatives are bad (\"recall errors\").\n",

    "But what decision agent should we use?  Unfortunately, it is somewhat tricky (though possible) to construct an efficient Bayes rule for the $F_1$ measure.  \n",
    "* First of all, the Bayes rule cannot just map each separate sentence to its best tagging.  The \"best\" tagging of one sentence actually depends on the other sentences!  So it would have to map the entire corpus to the best tagging of the corpus.  This would require annoying changes to our class design or our file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Mathematically, the problem is that the $F_1$ formula is not simply a sum over sentences $i$.  (Rather, the sums are buried inside the definitions of `true`, `pos`, and `true_pos`.)  As a result, the expected corpus-level $F_1$ is not simply a sum over sentences, so we can't simply maximize it by maximizing the expected $F_1$ for each sentence separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Intuitively, the problem is that to improve the corpus-level $F_1$, it is more helpful to improve whichever is currently lower, precision or recall.  So in deciding what to do on sentence $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$, we need to know the precision and recall for other sentences.  If precision is low elsewhere, then we should be cautious and predict only the few chunks of $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ where we are most confident, in order to get high precision even at the expense of recall.  If recall is low elsewhere, then we should be aggressive and predict lots of chunks, in order to get high recall even at the expense of precision.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Second, regardless of whether we want to maximize expected $F_1$ for a single sentence or for the whole test corpus, the Bayes rule prediction is tricky to compute efficiently, for similar reasons.  It can't just pick the highest-probability chunks, but must consider the probabilistic dependencies among chunks.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Bayes rule can still be obtained in polynomial time using some interesting probabilities ([Waegemans et al., 2014](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/waegeman14a/waegeman14a.pdf)) that we actually could still compute using finite-state dynamic programming \u2014 but that is one quantum too complicated for this assignment.  We don't want to fall back on brute force as in homework 1, either, because it would be astronomically slow: we'd have to iterate over all joint chunkings of the entire test corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"proxy\"></a>\n",
    "Thus, as a \"proxy\" for $F_1$, we will use a different reward measure that is related:\n",
    "$$R = \\text{true_pos} - \\lambda \\cdot \\text{false_pos}$$\n",
    "This is a linear function and doesn't present the same computational difficulties.  The expected $R$ for the corpus is now just a sum over all the sentences \u2014 and it will be relatively easy to use a weighted finite-state machine to compute the expected reward for each sentence.  We will construct a decision agent that maximizes expected $R$ rather than expected $F_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification is that $R$ is a fairly reasonable reward measure on its own.  The first term emphasizes recall (encourages positives in hopes of getting true positives).  The second term emphasizes precision (discourages positives for fear of getting false positives).  Thus, by controlling the relative weight of these two terms, $\\lambda$ indirectly controls the relative importance of precision and recall in our evaluation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply pick a $\\lambda$ value and evaluate our chunking system using $R$.  However, it is conventional to evaluate chunking systems using $F_1$ (and maybe for good reason, since $F_1$ strongly penalizes systems with very low precision or very low recall).  Also, it's not clear what $\\lambda$ value we should use, whereas $F_1$ explicitly specifies a particular standard tradeoff between precision and recall.  (The use of $F_1$ is meant as an application-independent convention.  If you have a real-world application that calls for a different tradeoff, you could use [$F_\\beta$ for some other $\\beta$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score#Formulation).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will in fact evaluate on test data using $F_1$.  To get good test performance, we'll choose $\\lambda$ to maximize the $F_1$ measure that our decision agent achieves on dev data.  In other words, although we're using the wrong kind of Bayes rule \u2014 a Bayes rule for $R$ rather than $F_1$ \u2014 we do have a free hyperparameter in the definition of $R$, and we tune it to trade off precision and recall in the way that $F_1$ likes the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should fill in the `IobTask0.reward` method above, which computes $R$ given $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we'll construct an FST that can compute `reward` for any $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}$.  This FST will let you consider all the possible $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}$ values using dynamic programming rather than brute force."

    "    * Tag-tag features also fire at the boundaries of $\\boldsymbol{y}$.  For example, the `I_EOS` feature fires if there is an `I EOS` bigram (which rewards or punishes any named entity that ends at the end of a sentence).  The factors contributed by these two features are labeled in the figure as $\\psi_{\\text{BOS}}$ and $\\psi_{\\text{EOS}}$.\n",
    "* Tag-word features.  For example, the `B_brussel` feature fires for every token of the word `brussel` that starts a chunk.  Exactly one tag-word feature fires at each position $j$, which adds a term $g_{tw}$ into the score, or equivalently multiplies a factor $\\psi_{tw} = \\exp g_{tw}$ into the unnormalized probability, as shown in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above factors are analogous to the transition and emission probabilities of HMMs.  This feature set deliberately limits the dependencies among the tags $y_j$ to be bigram dependencies.  This ensures that there exists a simple \"trellis\" WFSA that can score every possible $\\boldsymbol{y}$ \u2014 exactly the same WFSA as for an HMM (with about $J\\cdot|\\mathcal{Y}|$ states and $J\\cdot|\\mathcal{Y}|^2$ arcs).  Inference will take time proportional to the size of the trellis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the features in a CRF model $p(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ can depend freely on any property of $\\boldsymbol{x}$.  This does not change the topology of the trellis, but only makes its the weights dependent on $\\boldsymbol{x}$.  To illustrate some of this generality, we also include:\n",
    "* Tag-previous-word features.  For example, the `B_brussel_-1` feature fires for every chunk that is immediately preceded by the word `brussel`.  At each position, the factor contributed by these features is labeled as $\\psi_{tw_{-1}}$.  Note that the previous word may be $\\text{BOS}$.\n",

For example, a feature might fire on every span $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i:j}$ that appears in a list of university names and is marked as a chunk by $\\boldsymbol{y}$.  Such a \"segmental CRF\" goes beyond the bigram features shown above, and in general would require us to increase the trellis size and the runtime of inference from $O(J)$ to $O(J^2)$.)"

    "## Implementing the model\n",
    "\n",
    "As the formula makes clear, a CRF is just a Boltzmann distribution, expressed as a product of factors $\\psi$ that refer to different (possibly overlapping) portions of the output structure.  Thus, our implementation will extend the `BoltzmannModel` class from homework 1.  (This means we are still using brute-force algorithms \u2014 we'll fix that later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define our new subclass in such a way that it could be used for *any* tagging task \u2014 not just IOB tagging, but also part-of-speech tagging or syllable stress tagging.  There is a clean separation of concerns between the task setting above and the probability model below:\n",
    "* The choice of the IOB alphabet, the restriction on legal IOB tag sequences, and the special meanings of the IOB tags show up only in the task setting and its reward function.\n",
    "* Conversely, the bigram CRF structure and features show up only in the probability model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it's possible to mix-and-match different tagging tasks with different tagging models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we'll start with a brute-force model.  So just fill in the implementation of `score_with_gradient` below, remembering that the gradient $\\nabla G_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is just the vector of feature counts.  You will also have to fill in `initialize_params` to set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = 0$.  You should have $|\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Y}}|^2 + 2 \\cdot |\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Y}}| + 2 \\cdot |\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}| \\cdot |\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Y}}|$ parameters in your model, one for each of the features described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use an attribute called `.params`, as in homework 1.  (Homework 1 actually made it a property, but an ordinary attribute is simpler and will work better with some of the designs below.  As mentioned above, we changed `Probability.params` accordingly in `seq2class_homework1.py`, and so should you.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "But what kind of object is the value of `.params`?  How you store the parameters is up to you.  Some options:\n",
    "* You could stick with a single parameter vector $\\theta$ (exactly like `LogLinearModel` in homework 1).\n",
    "    * You could then decide to store the tag-tag parameters in one part of $\\theta$ and the tag-word parameters in another part.  By integerizing the tags and words, and using a systematic layout, you can use simple arithmetic to compute the distinct integer index for each parameter.  This is essentially a customized integerizer for the parameter names.\n",
    "    * Alternatively, instead of calculating indices via arithmetic, you could use a generic `Integerizer` object to map entire parameter names such as (tag, word) tuples to distinct integers that index the parameter vector.  This is easier, more elegant, probably less error-prone, and more reusable, if a bit slower.  \n",
    "        * *Caution:* When naming your parameters, be careful not to confuse the word 'I' with the tag 'I'.  In the same spirit, the boundary markers should not be represented as strings `BOS` and `EOS`, to prevent confusion if those strings also serve as tags or words.  (A good choice is to instead use the Python object `None` for any tag or word that is beyond the edge of the string, e.g., `xx[0]==None`, `yy[0]==None`, `yy[len(yy)]==None`.)\n",
    "* Perhaps more elegantly, instead of forcing the parameters into a vector shape, you could use distinct parameter *matrices* for the tag-tag feature weights and the tag-word feature weights.  Then the `params` object should store these matrices.  You will need a new class for this (call it `BigramCrfParams`).\n",
    "    * The gradient has the same shape as the parameter vector, so gradient would be stored in an object of the same class.  This class should implement at least `__isub__`  and `__rmul__` [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types), which will be called when `SGDTrainer` invokes `-=` and `*` to subtract a multiple of the gradient from the current `params`.  See `paramdict.py` for an illustration of how to do this.\n",
    "* In fact, as long as `params` is a new kind of object, that object doesn't even have to contain matrices at all.  It could just be a generic `ParamDict` (defined above) that maps parameter names directly to their weights.  `ParamDict` is not specific to our CRF, but could be used for any model, since it is very flexible: unlike `BigramCrfParams`, it doesn't commit to using a particular collection of matrices.  Just as with the `Integerizer` solution above, this elegant generic solution is easier than the customized solution but may be a bit slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to be asymptotically efficient, make use of *sparse* vectors or matrices.  The CRF's *parameters* can be naturally and efficiently stored in dense vectors or matrices.  However, the SGD *gradient* on a single training example $(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y})$ will be sparse, because only a few feature weights affect $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{y}\\mid\\boldsymbol{x})$; the gradient with respect to the other parameters is therefore 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploiting sparsity means that you shouldn't waste any time on all those zeroes.  You want the runtime for each training example to be proportional to the number of features that actually fire on the example, not the total number of features.  For example, an SGD step on a 20-word training sentence should adjust the tag-word parameters for only the \u2264 20 distinct words in that sentence, which might be a tiny subset of the full parameter vector if the vocabulary is large.  Using a sparse gradient vector is a way to avoid storing and adding useless zeroes for the rest of the parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some options if you want to try a sparse solution.  Be warned that in Python, these solutions *might* be slower than using dense numpy arrays.  The dense numpy array operations are highly optimized: they make low-level library calls that exploit hardware parallelism (vector processing on the CPU).  The sparse solutions are *asymptotically* faster, but they have to run explicit loops, which has overhead, especially in an interpreted language like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `ParamDict` solution is naturally sparse.\n",
    "* You could try SciPy's implementation of sparse vectors and matrices, `scipy.sparse.dok_matrix`.\n",
    "* Here's a fast data structure that mixes dense and sparse.  (This is what Jason would probably do in a streamlined C++ implementation.)  Store the params and gradient in parallel arrays \u2014 which allows rapid random access to the integerized parameters and their partial derivatives \u2014 but also pair the gradient array with a list of the indices of its (few) nonzero elements.  Thanks to this list, you can make each SGD step take time proportional to the number of features used on this step:\n",
    "    * To avoid creating a new gradient array (with lots of zeros) for each training example, `BigramCrfModel` should just reuse the same gradient array for every call to `score_with_gradient`.\n",
    "    * Taking an SGD step only requires visiting the nonzero elements.  \n",
    "    * These elements can be reset to zero at the start of the next call of `score_with_gradient`.  \n",
    "        * Better yet, you can write a specialized method that handles `params -= stepsize * gradient; gradient = 0` all at once.  This method iterates only once through the nonzero elements of gradient, applying them to params and resetting them to 0 as they are applied.  This avoids having to iterate again later to reset them.  It also means that visiting the same element a second time will have no additional effect (since it's been reset to 0), which means that you can add the index to the list without checking for duplicates.  (You can prevent most duplicates cheaply by declining to add an index when you update a non-0 element, since that element will already be on the list.  However, a duplicate will still arise in the rare case of updating from 0 to non-0 back to 0 to non-0; so it's important to know that this will not introduce an error.)\n",
    "    * To fit with the rest of the object-oriented design, you should create a simple class to represent the gradient vector as an (array, list) pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The vocabulary of word types\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model uses tag-word and tag-previous-word features, the number of features depends on the size of the vocabulary.  Some of the strategies above need to know the size of the vocabulary in advance.  Thus, your constructor for `BigramCrfModel` should take the vocabulary as an argument.  This can be any collection of word types or tokens (generally derived from training data).  The constructor will probably want to turn it into a `Set` or an `Integerizer`.  If word $w_i$ is not in the vocabulary (OOV), then no tag-word feature will fire at position $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ParamDict` strategy has the nice property that you *don't* actually need to know the full set of parameters in advance.  New parameters will start out as 0 when first accessed, and will be added lazily to the dictionary when first modified.  In fact, this would make it easy to implement an infinite-vocabulary model, where the `ParamDict` only stores nonzero weights for the finitely many words observed in training so far.  For this homework, however, you should respect the `vocab` argument to the constructor, which defines a finite vocabulary.  So you should explicitly avoid computing features on OOV words, although it is still ok to add the in-vocabulary features lazily to the `ParamDict` as you encounter them."

Let $\\beta(t)$ denote the total weight of all paths from state $t$ \u2014 where \"total\" uses $\\oplus$, so it is the minimum (e.g., 13) in the case of the tropical semiring.  Formally, the pushing algorithm replaces the weight $w$ on an arc $s \\stackrel{w}{\\rightarrow} t$ with $\\beta(s)^{-1}w \\otimes \\beta(t)$.  Thus, the $w$ arc receives an extra weight of $\\beta(t)$ that has been pushed back through $t$ from all the paths leaving $t$, but then the arc (like all of $s$'s out-arcs) pushes a weight of $\\beta(s)$ back through $s$.\n",

    "The above paragraph handles arc weights but not state weights.  Figure out and explain how the pushing algorithm should handle the weights at initial and final states, where the weight of a path from initial state $a$ to final state $z$ is $\\text{initial_weight}(a) \\otimes \\text{arc_weight} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\text{arc_weight} \\otimes \\text{final_weight}(z)$.  Convince yourself that after this algorithm has been run, all path weights are preserved and we have $\\beta(s) = \u2460$ at all states $s$.

Rather, it requires a single dedicated initial state whose initial weight is \u2460, and all other states have initial weight of \u24ea.

    "\n",
    "You already know the trick of switching from `RealSemiringWeight` to `LogSemiringWeight` (where $(\\oplus,\\otimes) = (\\text{logsumexp}, +)$).  But the logsumexp operation is a bit slow.  And in the case of expectation semirings, the $\\tilde{r}$ values may be as large or small as the $\\tilde{p}$ values, but can't be straightforwardly represented in the log domain because they may be negative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our `ExpectationSemiringWeight` class uses an alternative trick for avoiding underflow/overflow: it privately stores a scalar multiplier along with the $\\langle \\tilde{p},\\tilde{r} \\rangle$ pair.  This isn't unrelated to the log trick, since we actually store the *log* of the multiplier.  However, we ensure that this log is an integer, and we also store a multiplicand to account for the non-integer part and the sign.\n",

We continue to use floating-point representations for $\\tilde{p}$ and $\\tilde{r}$; it's just that our (shared) log-multiplier effectively extends the range of the exponent beyond what's possible in a standard 64-bit float.

    "#### Deeper discussion: The expectation semiring as a \"gradient semiring\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing expected gradient vectors above, we characterized the weight of path $\\boldsymbol{y}$ as $\\langle \\tilde{p}(\\boldsymbol{y}), \\tilde{p}(\\boldsymbol{y}) \\nabla G(\\boldsymbol{y}) \\rangle$.  Observe that this can be interpreted as $\\langle \\tilde{p}(\\boldsymbol{y}), \\nabla \\tilde{p}(\\boldsymbol{y}) \\rangle$ (since $\\tilde{p} = \\exp G$ by definition).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives another interpretation of the expectation semiring as a simple device for tracking gradients.  A weight's first element is merely a real number with the usual operations from the real semiring, and its second element is always the gradient of the first element (with respect to some parameters).  It is easy to check that the semiring operations do preserve this property under addition, multiplication, and division of the weights.  The total weight of all paths must therefore be $\\langle Z, \\nabla Z \\rangle$, and dividing the second element by the first element indeed gives the expected score gradient, since $\\frac{\\nabla Z}{Z} = \\nabla \\log Z = \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{y}\\sim p}[\\nabla G(\\boldsymbol{y})]$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But why should tracking gradients also be useful in computing expected *rewards*?  Well, with a little trickery, you can regard expected rewards as an example of expected feature values, and thereby get them from $\\nabla \\log Z$.  Redefine $\\tilde{p}(\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\exp(G(\\boldsymbol{y}) + R(\\boldsymbol{y})\\cdot \\theta_{\\text{reward}})$ where $R(\\boldsymbol{y})$ is now used as a log-linear feature and $\\theta_{\\text{reward}}$ is its weight.  By setting $\\theta_{\\text{reward}}=0$, you can prevent the reward model from affecting the probability model at all.  Yet the partial derivative $\\partial \\log Z / \\partial \\theta_{\\text{reward}}$ is still the expected feature value \u2014 that is, the expected reward you want!  This is another way to see why our expected reward computation worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait \u2014 if this is all about gradients, don't we have another way to compute gradients, namely automatic differentiation?  We do indeed.  In particular, you could just compute $Z$ in the real semiring (or the log semiring), but wrap each parameter as a PyTorch `Variable` (which mfst can handle by wrapping it further as `PythonValueSemiringWeight`).  Then `sum_paths` returns $Z$ as a `Variable`, and you could get $\\nabla \\log Z$ by backprop: `torch.log(Z).backward()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our method below for computing training gradients by forward-backward in the expectation semiring is actually isomorphic to this method.  So why did we bother implementing it, when PyTorch backprop is a highly optimized version of the same computation?  Well, the expectation semiring is interesting to think about, and perhaps more intuitive in the case of expected rewards.  It also doesn't require building a computation graph in memory; that graph is implicit in the FSA itself.  But the main reason is that our Bayes rule decoder will rely on manipulating an FSA in the expectation semiring."

    "You've been using the forward algorithm (`sum_paths`) to compute the total weight of `fsa_uprob`.  When the FSA is weighted by the expectation semiring, this is rather slow.  The reason is that every $\\oplus$ operation involves a vector sum, and every $\\otimes$ operation involves a linear combination of vectors.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, these are unfortunately *dense* vector operations.  Basically, you are sweeping from left to right through the FSA, adding up the features on the arcs as you encounter them.  For a state $s$ at time step $i$, the forward weight $\\alpha(s)$ includes a vector that is dense with all features encountered on all the length-$i$ paths to that state.  \n",

    "Remember, however, that the forward-backward algorithm is another way to compute expectations and gradients.  It turns out that `sum_paths` for machines in the expectation semiring can be computed faster by the forward-backward algorithm.  Here, instead of pushing feature vectors from the initial state to the final state, the feature vectors stay where they are, and we push scalar probabilities toward them from both sides to determine how heavily to weight them in the final sum.\n",

    "Specifically, suppose each arc $e$ in the machine is labeled with an expectation semiring weight $\\langle \\psi_e, \\boldsymbol{v}_e \\rangle$, and its source and destination states are $s_e$ and $t_e$.  Each final state $f$ has a final weight of $\\langle \\psi_f, \\boldsymbol{v}_f \\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Temporarily ignore the $\\boldsymbol{v}_e$ part of each weight so that our machine appears to be in the real semiring.  Run forward-backward over that simpler machine to obtain the forward probabilities $\\alpha(s)$, the backward probabilities $\\beta(t)$, and the sum of paths $Z = \\beta(\\text{initial state})$.  \n",

    "It turns out that the forward algorithm is a special case of *forward-mode automatic differentiation*, which computes the objective function $F(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and its gradient in parallel using a single forward pass through the computation graph.  As you know from our previous discussion of the expectation semiring, it replaces each node $x$ in the computation graph with a pair $\\langle x, \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} x \\rangle$, so that at the end, it has found $\\langle F, \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} x \\rangle$.  The trouble is that each $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} x$ is an entire vector in $\\mathbb{R}^K$ (all values $\\partial x / \\partial \\theta_k$),where $K$ is the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the forward-backward algorithm is a special case of *reverse-mode automatic differentiation*, which uses both a forward pass to compute $F$ and a backward pass to compute its gradient.  The backward pass augments each node $x$ with an adjoint, which is just a scalar ($\\partial F / \\partial x$) provided that $F(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is a scalar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, for a function $F: \\mathbb{R}^K \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, reverse-mode is much better.  (Forward-mode does win for a function $\\mathbb{R}^K \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{K'}$ where $K' \\geq K$, which is actually the case when we are computing expected reward.)"

    "A smarter agent would realize that the low recall is killing the F1 score.  To get F1 score up, it had better take a risk and predict some entities.  The safest entities to guess would be those with a high *marginal* probability, which means summing over paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a Bayes rule will do.  As we saw in homework 1, it will try to maximize our expected reward, or at least our expected [proxy reward](#proxy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The brute-force Bayes agent from homework 1 looped over the exponentially large set of `(aa,yy)` pairs to compute the Bayes decision $$ \\text{argmax}_a \\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim p(\\cdot | x)}[R(a | x, y)] $$\n",
    "But here's a sketch of a much faster algorithm for computing the optimal chunking under our particular proxy reward function, given our particular model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observe that in a sentence of length $J$, we have $O(J^2)$ possible chunks.  In principle, we can find the marginal probability of each of chunk.  For example, what is the marginal probability of a length-5 chunk starting at word 12?  Such a chunk corresponds to a `BIIII` substring that starts at word 12 and is not immediately followed by another `I`.  It's not too hard to see how to find the total weight of all such paths, with the help of pre-computed $\\alpha(s)$ and $\\beta(t)$ quantities to sum over the parts before and after `BIIII`.  A first guess is that it takes $O(J)$ time to score each of the $O(J^2)$ chunks, but maybe you can see how to do it in $O(J^2)$ time altogether.\n",
    "* If the marginal probability of a chunk is $p$, then the expected reward of including the chunk is $p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot (-\\lambda)$.  We would prefer to include the chunk if this is positive, i.e., if $p \\geq \\frac{\\lambda}{1+\\lambda} \\in (0,1)$.  (This fits with the idea that low $\\lambda$ induces us to predict more chunks.)\n",
    "* However, overlapping chunks are not allowed.  Thus, we must select a subset of non-overlapping chunks with the maximum *total* expected reward.  This is itself a dynamic programming problem.  (We might prefer to omit the most probable chunk if that would let us take two or more slightly less probable chunks.)  Maybe you can see how to handle this DP problem as finding the highest-weighted path in a certain acyclic graph, i.e., a problem in the $(\\max,+)$ semiring.  The graph has $O(J^2)$ edges \u2014 one per chunk \u2014 and thus this stage of the algorithm also takes $O(J^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we don't need to implement this algorithm from scratch or even design it!  The algorithm will pretty much fall out of a finite-state recipe, cooked with FSTs that are already in our pantry."
